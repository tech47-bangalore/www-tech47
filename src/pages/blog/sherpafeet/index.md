[sherpafeet](https://sherpafeet.com) is a platform for trekking guides. Trekking guides is a disorganised industry.
Anyone who has done a couple of treks can claim to be a trek guide. Thats great. But in the process, the native people who depend on this profession for their livelihood were losing out. sherpafeet is a social enterprise which not only helps the native people but is grounded on the core concepts of sustainability.

## Technology which drives sherpafeet
The sherpafeet platform is built on the MERN Stack. That is
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)


## Hosting and Devops
The platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

## Search Functionality
The search functionality on sherpafeet is powered by [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/)

## APIs
Instead of the traditional REST APIs we use [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)
